# Age-related changes in aspects of the rest-activity cycle and their relationship to memory and decision-making performance
This research is supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health under award number R01AG043425.

The purpose of this project is to investigate changes in cognitive functions associated with aging and examine how these effects are mediated by sleep-wake cycles.

## Actigraphy
- Processing script for actigraphy data
- Script for computing rest-activity measures using the extended cosinor method [(Marler et al., 2006)](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.2466)
- Visualize actigraphy data plots
- Determine variability in an individual's rest-activity measures based on the duration of the recording period

## MRI
- BIDS conversion
- Instructions for running fmriprep and mriqc
- DTI preprocessing
- Example job submission script for running fmriprep on tacc

## PVT
For psychomotor vigilance task analysis. We use PC-PVT [(Khitrov et al., 2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23709163).

## Analysis
